In EA FC 25 (formerly FIFA), the tactics code to import Pep Guardiola's setup for Manchester City in Career Mode—which can help simulate and achieve wins by replicating their real-life dominant style—is `1#P5MKK8#Vp`.

To use it:
- Go to Squad > Team Management > Tactics in the game menu.
- Navigate to the code input option (left or right in the tactics screen).
- Enter the code exactly as shown.

This sets up formations, player roles, and instructions optimized for possession-based play, making it easier to win matches with Man City.
